# How to create a project in GitLab

1. In your dashboard, click the green **New project** button or use the plus
   icon in the upper right corner of the navigation bar.

1. Provide the following information:
    - Enter the name of your project in the **Project name** field. You can't use
      special characters, but you can use spaces, hyphens, underscores or even
      emoji.
    - If you have a project in a different repository, you can [import it] by
      clicking an **Import project from** button provided this is enabled in
      your GitLab instance. Ask your administrator if not.
    - The **Project description (optional)** field enables you to enter a
      description for your project's dashboard, which will help others
      understand what your project is about. Though it's not required, it's a good
      idea to fill this in.
    - Changing the **Visibility Level** modifies the project's
      [viewing and access rights](../public_access/public_access.md) for users.

1. Click **Create project**.
