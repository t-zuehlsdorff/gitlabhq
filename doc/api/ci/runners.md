# Register and Delete Runners API

API used by Runners to register and delete themselves.

>**Note:**
This API is intended to be used only by Runners as their own
communication channel. For the consumer API see the
[new Runners API](../runners.md).

## Authentication

This API uses two types of authentication:

1. Unique Runner's token, which is the token assigned to the Runner after it
   has been registered.  This token can be found on the Runner's edit page (go to
   **Project > Runners**, select one of the Runners listed under **Runners activated for
   this project**).

2. Using Runners' registration token.
   This is a token that can be found in project's settings.
   It can also be found in the **Admin > Runners** settings area.
   There are two types of tokens you can pass: shared Runner registration
   token or project specific registration token.
